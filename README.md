Titanic Survivors Prediction

House Prices Prediction Features

**Mechanisms of Action (MOA) Prediction** - In this problem we need to predict multiple labels (206 targets)
I have tried different types of models, one which predicts all the targets in one model and second type where we predict different targets separately and combine all predictions for submission.  Second type of model with default RandomForest algorithm came out with F1 score of 99.82
